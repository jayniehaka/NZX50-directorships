## NZX50 directorships graph
This graph shows companies listed on the NZX50 (red nodes) and their directors (blue nodes).

### Data
These data were sourced from the [NZX](https://www.nzx.com/markets/nzsx/indices/NZ50) and [New Zealand Companies Office](http://www.business.govt.nz/companies) websites.

Some directors may have been duplicated if they are recorded on the Companies Office under different names (for example, with their middle name and without their middle name).

There were three entities which are not on the Companies Office register because they are not companies: FSF, GMT and VHP. Fonterra Shareholders' Fund is a special unit trust which allows outside investors to hold shares in Fonterra. It is managed by FSF Management Company Limited. Goodman Property Trust is managed by Goodman (NZ) Limited, the New Zealand Subsidiary of the ASX listed Goodman Group. Vital Healthcare Property Trust is managed by Vital Healthcare Management Limited. In each of these cases I used the Companies Office record for the management company.
